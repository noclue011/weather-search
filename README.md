## General Information
This project is an application that gives a 7 day forecast for any city in the US. The user has to enter a latitude and longitude for a city into the form, and the bottom of the page displays a 7 day forecast for that city, with a temperature and weather conditions displayed for the afternoon and night of each of those 7 days.

The project was created as an assignment for my Masters degree program. The assignment required me to create an application that connected directly to a public api to display the weather for a city.

## Project Status
no longer being worked on

While there are areas for improvement as outlined below, this project was meant to be a submission for an assignment that has already been completed. I may decide to come back to this if I have some free time, but otherwise there is no reason to work further on this completed assignment.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
* Get the forecast when a user enters a city name instead of a latitude and longitude.
* Update the look of the application to be more aesthetically pleasing.
* Have the 7 day forecast section of the page only show up after a user submits a search.
